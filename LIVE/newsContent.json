Using the Chainsaw will consume a charge and trigger a Chainsaw Sweep. During this time&#44; The Cannibal can extend the Chainsaw Sweep by pressing the power button before the power bar fully depletes. The more charges are used&#44; the longer the miss cooldown / tantrum (if colliding with obstacles). <br/><br/>Furthermore&#44; if The Cannibal revs the chainsaw for too long&#44; a tantrum is automatically triggered for the base duration of 5 seconds.<br/><br/>When a tantrum is triggered&#44; all remaining charges are consumed. The tantrum meter will pause as soon as the power button is released and will start going down when the chainsaw is put away.<br/><br/><b>Add&#45;ons:</b> Updated most of his add&#45;ons.<br/><br/><b>The Hillbilly:</b><br/><b>Power Changes</b><br/>Added the overheat mechanic. Using the chainsaw will now build up heat. When reaching the maximum amount of heat&#44; the chainsaw overheats and cannot be used until it has cooled off. If the heat meter fills up&#44; the chainsaw overheats.  If the chainsaw overheats during a chainsaw sprint: <li>The sprint is not interrupted</li><li>The chainsaw goes through the cooldown phase after the sprint has ended</li><br/><br/>The heat meter will pause as soon as the power button is released and will start going down when the chainsaw is put away. Furthermore&#44; the heat meter does not progress during The Hillbilly&#39;s various cooldown phases. This includes a chainsaw miss&#44; a chainsaw hit and colliding with an obstacle. <br/><b>Add&#45;ons:</b> Updated most of his add&#45;ons.<br/><br/><b>Perk Updates</b><li>Franklin&#39;s Demise: Instead of the item losing charges when dropped&#44; the Entity will consume the item after <b>150/120/90</b> seconds if it is not picked up. Additionally&#44; Franklin&#39;s Demise will reveal the aura of items on the ground within <b>32/32/32</b> meters</li><li>Knock Out: Now triggers on basic attacks only. Additionally&#44; Survivors put in the dying state by your basic attacks will crawl <b>50/50/50&#37;</b> slower for <b>15/15/15</b> seconds. During this time&#44; they are affected by the Blindness status effect.</li><li>Lightborn: Grants immunity to blindness caused by flashlights and firecrackers. Survivors that attempt blinding you have their aura revealed for <b>6/8/10</b> seconds.</li><li>Tinkerer: Now triggers at <b>70/70/70&#37;</b> (down from 85&#37;) and grants the Undetectable status effect for <b>12/14/16</b> seconds (up from 8/10/12) </li><br/><span class=\"Heading2\">BUG FIXES</span><br/>Various bug fixes.
