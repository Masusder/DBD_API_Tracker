To make it clearer what is required to increase a Survivor\u2019s Madness level&#44; we are making the following changes:<br/><li>Madness no longer decays over time.</li><li>Shock Therapy will add half of a Madness level to any Survivors hit.</li><li>Static Blast will add a full Madness level to any Survivors hit.</li><br/>In Numbers:<br/>Previously&#44; the thresholds for madness tier 1&#44; 2&#44; and 3 were 5&#44; 55&#44; and 105 points respectively<br/>Shock Therapy granted 30 points of Madness and Static Blast granted 50.<br/>While outside of the Terror Radius&#44; Madness would decay by 0.5 points per second.<br/>These thresholds were based on how much passive madness gain the Doctor used to have. Without that mechanic&#44; the Madness tresholds can be simplified.<br/>Previously&#44; the Order add-ons increased the amount of Madness inflicted by Static Blast. They now reduce Static Blast\u2019s cooldown instead.<br/>Previously&#44; the Discipline add-ons increased the amount of Madness inflicted by Shock Therapy. They now reduce the detonation delay of Shock Therapy instead.<br/>The Doctor\u2019s Madness can be customized by using his Affliction add-ons: Order&#44; Discipline&#44; Calm&#44;  Restraint and Obedience. Add-ons of the same type granted similar debuffs&#44; but each one varied slightly in magnitude or Madness threshold. The end result was that it was often unclear which add-on did what&#44; and the lower rarity add-ons often seemed very unappealing in comparison to the higher rarity ones. The Afflictions have now been standardized to be the same across all rarities. Only the passive bonus is different.<br/><br/><span class=\"Heading3\">Order (Illusionary pallets)</span><br/><li>Order Class 1: Reduces the cooldown of Static Blast by 2 seconds.</li><li>Order Class 2: Reduces the cooldown of Static Blast by 4 seconds</li><li>Order: Carter\u2019s Notes: Reduces the cooldown of Static Blast by 6 seconds.</li><br/>The Affliction of Order used to vary in terms of what Madness tier was required to show pallets&#44; and how far away from the Doctor pallets could spawn. These variables are now the same across Order Class 1&#44; 2&#44; and Carter\u2019s Notes<br/>Survivors with Madness suffer from the Affliction of Order.<br/><li>Broken pallets may appear to be replaced with Illusionary pallets that persist until approached.</li><li>A new Illusionary pallet is generated at the location of a random broken pallet every 20 seconds</li><li>The Doctor shares his patient\u2019s Madness in order to read the auras of Illusionary pallets.<br/><br/><span class=\"Heading3\">Discipline (Illusionary Killer Stain)</span><br/><li>Discipline Class 2: Slightly reduces the detonation delay of Shock Therapy.</li><li>Discipline Class 3:  Moderately reduces the detonation delay of Shock Therapy.</li><li>Discipline Carter\u2019s Notes:  Considerably reduces the detonation delay of Shock Therapy.</li><br/>The Affliction of Discipline used to vary in terms of how long the effect would stay active and whether they required a chase to activate. These variables are now the same across Discipline Class 2&#44; Class 3&#44; and Carter\u2019s Notes.<br/>Survivors with Madness suffer from the Affliction of Discipline:<br/><li>Madness Tier 2: While in a chase&#44; Survivors perceive an Illusionary Red Stain and Terror Radius as though the Doctor were right behind them. This effect persists for 6 seconds after the chase ends.</li><li>Madness Tier 3: Illusionary Red Stain and Terror Radius are constantly active.</li><li> The Doctor shares in his patients Madness in order to see the Illusionary Red Stain.</li><br/><br/><span class=\"Heading3\">Restraint (Illusionary Doctor)</span><br/><li>Restraint Class 2: Reveal Survivors\u2019 auras for 1 second when their Madness increases.</li><li>Restraint Class 3: Reveal Survivors\u2019 auras for 2 second when their Madness increases.</li><li> Restraint Carter\u2019s Notes: Reveal Survivors\u2019 auras for 3 second when their Madness increases.</li><br/>The Affliction of Restraint used to vary in terms of how much extra duration would be granted to Illusionary Doctor hallucinations. These variables are now the same across Restraint Class 2&#44; Restraint Class 3&#44; and Restraint Carter\u2019s Notes.<br/>The passive bonuses of the Restraint add-ons have not been changed.<br/>Survivors with Madness suffer from the Affliction of Restraint:<br/><li>Increased Illusionary Doctor duration to 8 seconds (These hallucinations normally last 1 second)</li><li>The Doctor shares in his patient\u2019s Madness in order to read the Auras of Illusionary Doctors at any level. (This effect is normally only active in Madness 3.</li><br/><span class=\"Heading3\">Calm (Illusionary Terror Radius)</span><br/><li>Calm Class 1: Terror radius increased/decreased by 4 meters.</li><li> Calm Class 2: Terror radius increased/decreased by 6 meters.</li><li>Calm Carter\u2019s Notes: Terror radius increased/decreased by 8 meters.</li><br/>Additive modifiers for Terror Radius are clearer and the result of stacking multiple modifiers is simpler to calculate. This is a slight increase in the effect for Class 1 and 2&#44; and Carter\u2019s Notes are equivalent.<br/>The Affliction of Calm used to vary in terms of what Madness tier was required to activate it&#44; how long it stayed active&#44; and how long it took between activations. These variables are now the same across Calm Class 1&#44; Class 2&#44; and Carter\u2019s Notes.<br/>Survivors with Madness suffer from the Affliction of Calm:<br/><li>Madness 2: Intermittently causes Survivors to hear a distant Illusionary Heartbeat</li><li>Madness 3: Constantly causes Survivors to hear a distant Illusionary Heartbeat.</li><br/><br/><span class=\"Heading3\">Obedience (Reverse Skill Checks)</span><br/>Obedience broke the pattern of Affliction add-ons and has been removed. Reverse Skill Checks have been integrated into the Doctor\u2019s base ability.<br/>When afflicted by a Madness Skill Check&#44; there is a 33% chance of an off-center Skill Check&#44; a 33% chance of a Reverse Skill Check&#44; and a 33% chance of a Reverse off-center Skill Check. This is baseline and requires no Add-ons.<br/> Scrapped Tape&#44; which was previously removed&#44; has returned to take Obedience Class 3\u2019s place.<br/><br/><span class=\"Heading3\">Iridescent King</span><br/>Previously&#44; this Add-on would inflict a random Affliction on a Survivor every time they were shocked. These Afflictions would stack&#44; until a Survivor had all 5 Afflictions after 5 Shocks. However&#44; this was mostly unnecessary&#44; as these Afflictions still had the same madness tresholds for activation. In light of the changes to the Afflictions&#44; Iridescent King has been simplified and the need to shock Survivors to inflict Afflictions has been removed:<br/>Survivors with Madness suffer from the Afflictions of Calm&#44; Discipline&#44; Order&#44; and Restraint:<br/><li>Intermittently causes Survivors to hear a distant Illusionary Heartbeat.</li><li>While in a chase&#44; Survivors perceive an Illusionary Red Stain and Terror Radius as though the Doctor were right behind them. This effect persists for 6 seconds after the chase ends and is constantly active in Madness 3.</li><li>Increases Illusionary Doctor duration to 8 seconds and grants the ability to read their auras at any level of Madness.</li><br/><br/><span class=\"Heading3\">Electrodes</span><br/>The Electrode Add-ons increased Shock Therapy range by a percentage at the cost of a small penalty to Shock Therapy charge speed. This has been changed to grant extra range (in meters) with no penalty.<li> Mouldy Electrode: Increases the range of Shock Therapy by 2 meters.</li><li>Polished Electrode: Increases the range of Shock Therapy by 3 meters.</li><li> High Stimulus Electrode: Increases the range of Shock Therapy by 4 meters.</li><li> Interview Tape: Range increased from 20 meters to 24 meters.</li><br/><span class=\"Heading3\">SURVIVOR PERKS</span><br/><li>Saboteur: See Hook auras in a 56 meters radius from the pickup spot if a Survivor is being carried. Sabotaging a Hook without a toolbox takes 2.5 seconds. The Sabotage action has a 60 seconds cooldown.</li><li>Ace in the Hole: Now adds the ability to keep the add-ons when escaping a trial with an item.</li><br/><span class=\"Heading3\">BUG
