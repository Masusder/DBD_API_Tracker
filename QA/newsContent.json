Using the Chainsaw will consume a charge and trigger a Chainsaw Sweep. During this time&#44; The Cannibal can extend the Chainsaw Sweep by pressing the power button before the power bar fully depletes. The more charges are used&#44; the longer the miss cooldown / tantrum (if colliding with obstacles). <br/><br/>Furthermore&#44; if The Cannibal revs the chainsaw for too long&#44; a tantrum is automatically triggered for the base duration of 5 seconds.<br/><br/>When a tantrum is triggered&#44; all remaining charges are consumed.
